## Description
The organization of a trainnetwork is a very complex problem and can be solved with the help of AI-techniques. The goal of this project is to search for optimal line management solutions for the trainnetwork in the Dutch provinces North- and South-Holland and eventually the complete trainnetwork of The Netherlands. The focus here lays on the trajectories of intercity trains use during the day. This implies that there have to be created a couple of trajectories within a certain timeframe. In this case a trajectory is a route of tracks and stations on which trains can travel back and forth. Eventually the algorithm has to produce the most efficient line management solution as possible.

The former can be done with the help of the following equation:

`K = p * 1000 = (T * 100 + Min)`

K = quality of the line management
p = fraction of the ridden connections (number between 0 and 1)
T = the number of trajectories
Min = the number of minutes of all the trajectories taken together

This project is part of the 'Programmeertheorie' course of the programming minor of the University of Amsterdam.
